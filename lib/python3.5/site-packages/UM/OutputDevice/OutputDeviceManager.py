##  Manages all available output devices and the plugin objects used to create them.
#
#   This class is intended as the main entry point for anything relating to file saving.
#   For the most basic usage, call getActiveDevice() to get an output device, then
#   call OutputDevice::requestWrite() on the returned object.
#
#   Active Device
#   -------------
#
#   The active device by default is determined based on the priority of individual
#   OutputDevice instances when there is more than one OutputDevice available. When
#   adding a device, the active device will be updated with the highest priority device.
#   Should there be two devices with the same priority the active device will be the first
#   device encountered with that priority.
#
#   Calling setActiveDevice() will override this behaviour and instead force the active
#   device to the specified device. This active device will not change when a new device
#   is added or removed, but it will revert back to the default behaviour if the active
#   device is removed. Call resetActiveDevice() to reset the active device to the default
#   behaviour based on priority.
#
#   OutputDevicePlugin and OutputDevice creation/removal
#   ----------------------------------------------------
#
#   Each instance of an OutputDevicePlugin is meant as an OutputDevice creation object.
#   Subclasses of OutputDevicePlugin are meant to perform device lookup and listening
#   for events like device hot-plugging. When a new device has been detected, the plugin
#   class should create an instance of an OutputDevice subclass and add it to this
#   manager class using addOutputDevice(). Similarly, if a device has been removed the
#   OutputDevicePlugin is expected to call removeOutputDevice() to remove the proper
#   device.
